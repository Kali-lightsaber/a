Trivial CLI frontend to apt-* commands, providing a faster work-flow
for common apt-get/apt-cache operations, such as install and search.

It's trivial, really.

Typical usage:
 a i perl-doc   <-- install perl-doc (same as: sudo apt-get install perl-doc)

 a s librd      <-- search for a package (librd), then select desired
                    package and pick 'Show' to display output from
                    'apt-cache show <pkg>' or/and 'Install' to install it.

 a l /bin/bash  <-- locate and print what package provides the specified file.

Its nothing new, just seconds saved here and there, summing up to hundreds of
saved seconds per year!


Install it in your PATH and off you go the next time it's time to install
a package.
